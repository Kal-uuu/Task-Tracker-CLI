#TODO LIST CLI

My project allows you to make task you would normally put in a todo list and also
gives you the freedom to make changes to them

Here are some commands to help you run it easily:

1. add - adds task to list
2. update - update task description
3. delete - deletes task
4. mark - Changes status of task, basically your progress in the task
5. list_ all - List all task
6. list_by_status - List task according to the status

**Note:**

**"python main.py"** is a command that is common throughout and 
must be typed first before adding these to complete your command
